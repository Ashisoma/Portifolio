        <p id="bill">I am a Software Development student at Moringa School. Currently I am studying on
            the remote learning program set by Moringa School. Before joining 
            Moringa School, i had just completed my highschool and was looking for a
            technical career path. That is when in March i leant of the school and enrolled.
            I had the passion to pursue programming and wanted to get started
            before i could do a degree program. This would be an advantage since many poeple
            go for their degrees before undertaking such a path at a school as Moringa.
             I studied at Maseno School where i did my KCSE. i have alo worked as an Assistant
             at Arnjawalla and Khanna in February this year.
